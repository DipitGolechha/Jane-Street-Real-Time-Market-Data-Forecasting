# Jane-Street-Real-Time-Market-Data-Forecasting
The following repository contains all the codes and models generated by me and my teammate Devesh Shah for the Kaggle competition hosted by Jane Street (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-real-time-market-data-forecasting)

The following notebooks contains different models created and used on the jane street dataset which was a anonymized and lightly obfuscated some of the features and responders they presented. 

The different models that were created were:
1. XGBoost 
2. Linear regression 
3. Linear regression with online learning
4. Long short term memory 
5. Linear regression with lagged features
6. lightgbm
7. Catboost
8. XGBoostRegressor

There are also a few data pre processing, data understanding notebooks. 

A combination of all these models were also used together to achieve better results, the startegies that helped were online learning and lagged features since they gave our models a edge. 

The models directoy contains the models generated by our codes and ones we have used in our submissions as well.
